# Go Pac-Man
An ASCII generated terminal version of the popular game Pac-Man.

To get started, make sure go is properly installed and run:

    go run gopacman.go
    
Controls:

> ESC: Close the Game
> ↑↓←→: Motion Controls
> Presumably this list will expand in the future as more features are added

This is a side project to learn GoLang, it's functionality and design principals.
This will eventually be broadcast to a web client through websocket as a live game once the terminal version is fully functional.
